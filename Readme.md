# SQL Queries

This project consist of Testing the domain of SQL queries by requesting them to retrieve and organize different pieces of data from a table from SQL Zoo.

###  The tutorials are as follows
```
1. SELECT Basics
2. SELECT FROM World
3. SELECT FROM nobel
4. SELECT in SELECT
5. SUM and COUNT
6. JOIN
7. More JOIN

9. SELF JOIN
```
